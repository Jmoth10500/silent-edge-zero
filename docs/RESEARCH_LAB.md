Every modelling hypothesis, tracked honestly. Most will fail — that's expected (Section 39).

## RL-001: Weather materially improves prediction accuracy on AW vs turf

- **Hypothesis:** All-weather (AW) surfaces are less weather-sensitive than turf; a weather-interaction feature should show near-zero effect on AW races and a real effect on turf, particularly on going-adjacent features (rainfall correlating with turf going changes).
- **Why it might work:** turf going is directly driven by rainfall; AW surfaces are engineered to be more consistent.
- **Implementation:** not yet — needs Phase 5 (feature engineering) built first.
- **Training/validation period:** TBD, needs real racecard history first.
- **Status: IDEA** — logged now so it isn't lost, tested once real data exists.

## RL-002: Overround-removal method choice (proportional vs power vs Shin) materially changes calibration

- **Hypothesis:** Shin's method, by modelling favourite-longshot bias explicitly, should produce better-calibrated market-probability baselines than proportional scaling, particularly at the long-odds end of the field.
- **Why it might work:** proportional scaling assumes overround is spread evenly across all runners, which doesn't match observed bookmaker behaviour (shorter-priced runners typically carry proportionally less margin).
- **Implementation:** `src/market/probability.py` — all three methods built and unit-tested (2026-09-08).
- **Training/validation period:** needs real historical odds + results to actually benchmark against — the current tests only confirm the methods are mathematically correct (sum to 1, favourite gets highest probability), not which is more accurate.
- **Status: TESTING (partial)** — implementation done and correct, empirical benchmark blocked on real odds history (needs The Racing API or Betfair access).
