Every modelling hypothesis, tracked honestly. Most will fail — that's expected (Section 39).

## RL-001: Weather materially improves prediction accuracy on AW vs turf

- **Hypothesis:** All-weather (AW) surfaces are less weather-sensitive than turf; a weather-interaction feature should show near-zero effect on AW races and a real effect on turf, particularly on going-adjacent features (rainfall correlating with turf going changes).
- **Why it might work:** turf going is directly driven by rainfall; AW surfaces are engineered to be more consistent.
- **Implementation:** not yet — needs Phase 5 (feature engineering) built first.
- **Training/validation period:** TBD, needs real racecard history first.
- **Status: IDEA** — logged now so it isn't lost, tested once real data exists.

## RL-002: Overround-removal method choice (proportional vs power vs Shin) materially changes calibration

- **Hypothesis:** Shin's method, by modelling favourite-longshot bias explicitly, should produce better-calibrated market-probability baselines than proportional scaling, particularly at the long-odds end of the field.
- **Why it might work:** proportional scaling assumes overround is spread evenly across all runners, which doesn't match observed bookmaker behaviour (shorter-priced runners typically carry proportionally less margin).
- **Implementation:** `src/market/probability.py` — all three methods built and unit-tested (2026-09-08).
- **Training/validation period:** needs real historical odds + results to actually benchmark against — the current tests only confirm the methods are mathematically correct (sum to 1, favourite gets highest probability), not which is more accurate.
- **Status: TESTING (partial)** — implementation done and correct, empirical benchmark blocked on real odds history (needs The Racing API or Betfair access).

## RL-003: Recency-weighted form score vs simple average finishing position

- **Hypothesis:** weighting a horse's most recent runs more heavily (linear weights, most recent = highest) predicts better than a flat average of the same runs.
- **Why it might work:** form is not static — a horse improving or declining recently is more informative than an old good/bad run buried in a longer form string.
- **Implementation:** `src/features/runner_features.py::form_score(recency_weighted=True)` — both the weighted and unweighted variants are implemented so they can be compared directly once real results exist.
- **Design choice flagged for review:** non-completion codes (F/P/U/O/R/S/B) are scored as a fixed penalty (12 — worse than any real finishing position) rather than dropped from the form string. This is a reasonable default, not a validated one — worth checking whether a fall vs a pulled-up run should really carry the same weight once real data can distinguish them.
- **Training/validation period:** TBD, needs real racecard + result history first.
- **Status: IDEA** — implemented and unit-tested against synthetic form strings only (2026-09-08); no real predictive comparison yet.

## RL-004: Draw percentile as a neutral geometric feature vs a track-specific bias feature

- **Hypothesis:** a raw draw_percentile (0 = rail, 1 = widest, based only on the field present) is a weaker feature than a track+distance-specific historical draw bias, but is a reasonable and honest placeholder until real per-course historical data exists.
- **Why it might work / why it's a placeholder:** genuine draw bias is course- and distance-specific (e.g. a low draw can be a major advantage at one course/distance and irrelevant at another) — that requires historical results grouped by course+distance, which doesn't exist yet.
- **Implementation:** `src/features/runner_features.py::draw_bias_features()` — deliberately does NOT claim any bias direction, just the neutral positional fact.
- **Training/validation period:** TBD — needs real historical results per course+distance (Phase 5+, once The Racing API or Kaggle data lands).
- **Status: IDEA** — flagged so the next session doesn't mistake the neutral placeholder for a validated bias model.

## RL-005: Market baseline (Model 0) as the bar every real model must clear

- **Hypothesis:** the de-vigged market-implied probability (src/market/probability.py), used directly as a "prediction" with no fitting at all, is already a strong baseline — real money is priced into it. Any trained model built later (Phase 6+) that can't beat Model 0's Brier score / log loss on the same walk-forward test windows isn't adding information the market didn't already have.
- **Why it might work / why it's the right null hypothesis:** bookmaker/exchange odds already aggregate a lot of public information (form, ratings, weather, etc.) through pricing behaviour. A model that can't beat this baseline is, at best, redundant with the market.
- **Implementation:** `src/models/model0_market_baseline.py::predict_race_probabilities` (wraps the existing overround-removal methods) + `evaluate_market_baseline_walk_forward` (wires it through the walk-forward split harness and calibration scoring end-to-end). Tested with hand-verified Brier scores against synthetic zero-overround odds (2026-09-08) — see `tests/test_model0_market_baseline.py`.
- **Design choice flagged for review:** which of the three overround-removal methods (proportional/power/Shin, see RL-002) Model 0 should default to is still unresolved — same blocker as RL-002, needs real odds history to benchmark.
- **Training/validation period:** TBD — Model 0 has no training step by design, but its *evaluation* needs real (race_date, odds, winner) rows, which needs The Racing API or Betfair access (both blocked, see FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md).
- **Status: IDEA** — pipeline plumbing implemented and unit-tested against synthetic data only; no real-data run yet.
