# Build Log

This file is read by the autonomous continuation routine at the start of every
run — it exists so a fresh session with zero memory of this conversation can
pick up exactly where the last one stopped, without re-deriving anything or
re-doing finished work.

## 2026-09-08 — Session 1 (interactive, this build)

**Phase reached:** early Phase 2/3 boundary (database done, first live provider done, market math done, leakage tests done). Phases 1–2 substantially complete; Phase 3 (daily collector) partially blocked.

**What's genuinely done and verified:**
- `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md` — 5 sources researched via live web search, honestly rated LIVE/BLOCKED/reference-only
- `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` — architecture overview
- `docs/FUTURE_PAID_UPGRADES.md`, `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` — started
- `db/schema.sql` + `db/init_db.py` — real Postgres 16 database `silent_edge_zero`, 13 tables, applied and verified locally (this machine's Homebrew Postgres, already running, zero new cost)
- `src/providers/base.py` — provider interfaces (RacecardProvider, OddsProvider, ResultsProvider, RatingsProvider, WeatherProvider, ExternalPredictionProvider)
- `src/providers/weather_open_meteo.py` — **LIVE and verified**: real HTTP calls to Open-Meteo, no key needed
- `scripts/collect_weather.py` — **ran successfully**, stored real weather snapshots for 13 GB racecourses in `weather_snapshot` table, 2026-09-08
- `src/market/probability.py` — proportional/power/Shin overround-removal, all three implemented
- `tests/test_market_probability.py` — 5 real unit tests, all passing (found and fixed a genuine bug in power_method's bisection bounds for underround edge cases, and added a guard in shin_method for the same)
- `tests/test_leakage.py` — 2 real tests against the live database, both passing; confirms the leakage-safe query pattern actually excludes future-dated snapshots
- `src/providers/racecard_theracingapi.py` — **STUB, untested**, written against public docs, field-name mapping unverified (needs a real API response to confirm)
- `scripts/load_kaggle_historical.py` — **STUB, untested**, blocked on Kaggle account

**What's blocked on Jonathan specifically (cannot be done by Claude):**
1. Sign up for The Racing API (theracingapi.com) — highest priority, unblocks racecards/results/odds in one step
2. Create a free Kaggle account + API token for the historical bootstrap dataset
3. Create a free Betfair developer account + Delayed App Key for market prices

**What the next autonomous session should do, in priority order (all free, no account needed):**
1. Check `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md` — has Jonathan sent an API key since the last run? If yes, that unblocks real Phase 3 work (test the racecard provider against real data, fix its field mapping, wire up a real daily collector). Check for a note in this file or ask via the routine's summary.
2. If still blocked: continue Phase 5 groundwork — feature engineering functions (Section 8: official rating, age, weight, draw, form; Section 10: relative/percentile features within a race) written against clearly-labelled synthetic fixtures (never presented as real predictions), with real unit tests.
3. Build `src/market/movement.py` — price movement features (Section 16: opening price, current price, price change %, drift/shortening) — pure math, no external data needed, can be fully built and tested now.
4. Build the calibration scaffolding (Section 24: Brier score, log loss, calibration curve functions) — pure math, testable now with synthetic prediction/outcome pairs.
5. Build the walk-forward validation harness (Section 29) as a reusable function, tested against synthetic chronological data, ready to run the moment real historical data exists.
6. Add a Postgres trigger enforcing prediction immutability once `locked_at` is set (mentioned as a TODO in `tests/test_leakage.py`'s second test).
7. Keep this file updated at the end of every session — add a new dated section above this instruction, don't overwrite prior sessions' entries.

**Do NOT do, even if it seems like faster progress:**
- Do not fabricate racecard/odds/result data to "demo" a working pipeline — Section 60 of the build brief is explicit about this, and it would poison the leakage tests' credibility
- Do not create accounts on Jonathan's behalf (Racing API, Kaggle, Betfair) — these are genuinely blocked until he acts
- Do not scrape britishhorseracing.com or any other site not yet permission-checked — see FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md #5

## 2026-09-08 — Session 2 (autonomous overnight)

**Checked for new credentials first, per the ground rules:** searched `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md`, git log, and this container's environment for any API key/token Jonathan might have sent since Session 1. **Nothing found** — all three signups (The Racing API, Kaggle, Betfair) are still genuinely blocked on him. Did not create any accounts. Proceeded straight to BUILD_LOG's priority list items 2–6 (all free, no account needed), skipping item 1 since it's still blocked.

**Environment note for future sessions (this matters, read it):** this autonomous routine runs in a fresh ephemeral cloud container each time, not on Jonathan's own Homebrew-Postgres machine that Session 1 used. Postgres wasn't running and there was no DB role for the container's OS user (peer auth failed with `role "root" does not exist`). Fixed by starting the `postgresql` service and creating a matching superuser role, then wrote **`db/setup_local_postgres.sh`** (idempotent, safe to re-run) so every future session does this in one step instead of re-diagnosing it. Run it once per fresh container, before `db/init_db.py`. This is a local dev/test convenience only — zero new infrastructure, zero cost, same local Postgres 16.

**What's genuinely done and verified this session (all real code, all with real passing tests — 50/50 tests pass via `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`):**
- `src/market/movement.py` — price movement features (Section 16): `opening_price`, `current_price`, `price_change_pct`, `max_price`, `min_price`, `movement_classification` (DRIFTING/STEADY/SHORTENING, configurable threshold). Pure math, no external data. `tests/test_market_movement.py` — 8 tests, including an out-of-order-input case (sorts by `observed_at`, not list order) and threshold configurability.
- `src/evaluation/calibration.py` — Brier score, log loss, calibration curve (Section 24). Input validation (mismatched lengths, empty input, non-binary outcomes all raise `ValueError`). `tests/test_calibration.py` — 12 tests, including known hand-calculated values (e.g. constant p=0.5 Brier = 0.25, log loss at p=0.5 = ln(2)) and an off-by-one check for p=1.0 landing in the last bin, not overflowing.
- `src/features/runner_features.py` — Section 8 (official rating, age, weight, draw, form) and Section 10 (race-relative/percentile features) built against clearly-labelled synthetic fixtures, never presented as real predictions. `parse_recent_form`/`form_score` (recency-weighted vs flat average, both implemented so they can be compared once real data exists — see `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` RL-003), `relative_official_rating` (rank/percentile/vs-mean, ties share rank), `draw_bias_features` (neutral positional percentile only — deliberately NOT a track-specific bias claim, see RL-004), `relative_weight`. Runners missing a field are omitted from that feature's output, never imputed. `tests/test_runner_features.py` — 13 tests.
- `src/validation/walk_forward.py` — chronological walk-forward split harness (Section 29). Expanding or fixed-size rolling windows, configurable step; asserts internally that every split it produces is actually chronological (train strictly precedes test) as a hard safety net, not just a docstring promise. `tests/test_walk_forward.py` — 9 tests, including a shuffled-input-order case (indices must map back to the caller's original row order, not a re-sorted one) and rejection of non-positive parameters.
- **Postgres trigger enforcing prediction immutability** (the TODO explicitly flagged in Session 1's `tests/test_leakage.py`): `trg_prevent_locked_prediction_update` in `db/schema.sql` — `BEFORE UPDATE` on `prediction`, rejects any update where `OLD.locked_at IS NOT NULL`. Added idempotently (`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` + `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS`), re-applied to the live DB and verified. Upgraded `tests/test_leakage.py`'s previously-placeholder second test into a real test: inserts an unlocked prediction, confirms it CAN be updated, locks it, confirms the trigger rejects a further update (`psycopg2.errors.RaiseException`), cleans up. `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` rule 3 updated to reflect this is now DB-enforced, not just an ORM-layer promise.
- Docs updated to match: `README.md` (quick start now runs the full pytest suite and the new Postgres bootstrap script), `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` (directory layout + integrity rules), `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` (RL-003, RL-004 — flagging the form-scoring and draw-percentile design choices as unvalidated defaults, not claims).

**What's still blocked on Jonathan specifically (unchanged from Session 1):**
1. Sign up for The Racing API (theracingapi.com) — still the highest-priority unblock, racecards/results/odds in one step
2. Free Kaggle account + API token for the historical bootstrap dataset
3. Free Betfair developer account + Delayed App Key for market prices

**What the next autonomous session should do, in priority order:**
1. **Check for a key/credential first, as always** — `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md` and recent commits. If The Racing API key has arrived: run `./db/setup_local_postgres.sh && python3 db/init_db.py` first (fresh container), then test `src/providers/racecard_theracingapi.py` against a real response, fix its field-name mapping, and wire up a real daily collector script (`scripts/collect_racecards.py`, doesn't exist yet) — this is Phase 3 proper.
2. If still blocked: wire `src/features/runner_features.py` and `src/market/movement.py` together into a single per-runner feature vector function (Section 8+10+16 combined), still against synthetic fixtures, still real-tested — this is the shape the eventual model input will actually take, worth having ready.
3. Build the Model 0 (market baseline) scaffold (Section 18/19-ish): a function that takes de-vigged market probabilities (already built in `src/market/probability.py`) and treats them AS a prediction, so `src/evaluation/calibration.py` and `src/validation/walk_forward.py` have something real (if trivial) to run against end-to-end before any actual model exists. This closes the loop from "pure math functions" to "an actual, if dumb, working prediction pipeline" without needing any blocked data source — a market-implied-probability baseline needs the same odds data any other model would need, so this can only be smoke-tested with synthetic odds until Racing API/Betfair unblocks, but the pipeline plumbing (walk-forward split → predict → score) can be built and tested now.
4. Keep using `db/setup_local_postgres.sh` at the start of any session that touches the DB — do not silently start debugging a "role does not exist" error again, it's already solved.
5. Keep this file updated at the end of every session — add a new dated section above this instruction, don't overwrite prior sessions' entries.

**Do NOT do, even if it seems like faster progress (still applies):**
- Do not fabricate racecard/odds/result data to "demo" a working pipeline
- Do not create accounts on Jonathan's behalf (Racing API, Kaggle, Betfair)
- Do not scrape britishhorseracing.com or any other site not yet permission-checked
- Do not skip re-running the full test suite before committing — all 50 tests must actually pass, not just the new ones

## 2026-09-08 — Session 3 (autonomous overnight)

**Checked for new credentials first, per the ground rules:** re-checked `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md`, `git log --all`, and this container's environment (`env | grep -iE "racing|kaggle|betfair|api_key|apikey"`) for anything Jonathan might have sent since Session 2. **Nothing found** — all three signups (The Racing API, Kaggle, Betfair) are still genuinely blocked on him. Did not create any accounts. Proceeded to Session 2's priority list items 2–3 (both free, no account needed), skipping item 1 since it's still blocked.

**Environment note:** this container's local `main` branch ref was stale (pointed at Session 1's commit) even though `origin/main` already had Session 2's commit — the working tree itself was a detached HEAD sitting on the right (Session 2) commit. Fixed with `git checkout -B main origin/main` before starting; no data was lost, this was just a stale local ref in a fresh container, not a real divergence. Re-ran `./db/setup_local_postgres.sh && python3 db/init_db.py` (fresh container, as expected) and `pip install pytest psycopg2-binary` (both already in `requirements.txt`, just not pre-installed in this container) before touching anything.

**What's genuinely done and verified this session (all real code, all with real passing tests — 64/64 tests pass via `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`, up from 50):**
- `src/features/feature_vector.py` — `build_runner_feature_vectors()`, combining `src/features/runner_features.py` (Sections 8+10) and `src/market/movement.py` (Section 16) into one flat per-runner feature dict — the actual shape a model's input row will eventually take. Every runner in the input always gets an output entry; every individual missing feature (no rating, no price history, only one price observation, etc.) is omitted from that runner's dict, never imputed — same rule the two underlying modules already enforce, just carried through the merge. `tests/test_feature_vector.py` — 7 tests, including a full-merge case across all three feature groups with hand-checked rank/percentile/price values, and a case confirming a horse absent from `price_history` gets zero price-derived keys (not zeros).
- `src/models/model0_market_baseline.py` — **Model 0, the market baseline**, per Session 2's priority item 3. `predict_race_probabilities()` treats the de-vigged market probability (`src/market/probability.py`, already built) directly as the prediction — no fitting, no parameters, by design (it's the null hypothesis every real model must beat, see `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` RL-005). `evaluate_market_baseline_walk_forward()` wires this through the existing walk-forward split harness (`src/validation/walk_forward.py`) and Brier/log-loss/calibration scoring (`src/evaluation/calibration.py`) end-to-end — chronological split → predict test-window races → score. This closes the loop Session 2 flagged: "pure math functions" → "an actual, if dumb, working prediction pipeline", fully smoke-tested now, ready to point at real (race_date, odds, winner) rows the moment The Racing API or Betfair unblocks. `tests/test_model0_market_baseline.py` — 7 tests, including one that hand-verifies exact Brier scores (0.25 and 1/9) against synthetic zero-overround odds across two walk-forward splits, and confirms a train-only race is correctly excluded from scoring.
- Docs updated to match: `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` (directory layout: `feature_vector.py`, `model0_market_baseline.py`, and their test files added), `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` (new entry RL-005: Model 0 as the bar every real model must clear, status IDEA — pipeline tested on synthetic data only, no real-data run yet).
- Full test suite re-run and confirmed green after every change, per the ground rules: `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` → 64/64 passed, including the DB-backed `tests/test_leakage.py` tests (ran against a freshly bootstrapped local Postgres in this container).

**What's still blocked on Jonathan specifically (unchanged from Sessions 1–2):**
1. Sign up for The Racing API (theracingapi.com) — still the highest-priority unblock, racecards/results/odds in one step
2. Free Kaggle account + API token for the historical bootstrap dataset
3. Free Betfair developer account + Delayed App Key for market prices

**What the next autonomous session should do, in priority order:**
1. **Check for a key/credential first, as always** — `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md`, recent commits, and container env vars. If The Racing API key has arrived: run `./db/setup_local_postgres.sh && python3 db/init_db.py` first (fresh container), then test `src/providers/racecard_theracingapi.py` against a real response, fix its field-name mapping, and wire up a real daily collector script (`scripts/collect_racecards.py`, doesn't exist yet) — this is Phase 3 proper. This has now been the #1 item for three sessions running; if it's still blocked, don't re-derive that fact from scratch, just move to item 2.
2. If still blocked: there is genuinely very little synthetic-fixture plumbing left to build without real data — the split→predict→score loop, feature vectors, market math, and calibration are all done and tested. Worthwhile next synthetic-only work: (a) an `odds_betfair.py` provider stub written against Betfair's public Exchange API docs (STUB, untested, same status as `racecard_theracingapi.py` — the directory layout in `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` already lists this file but it does not exist yet, that's a doc/reality mismatch worth fixing either by writing the stub or by correcting the doc); (b) a second, deliberately-different Model 0 variant using each of the three overround methods side by side on the SAME synthetic race set, to at least confirm the plumbing supports comparing methods (not a real benchmark — that still needs real odds — but proves the harness can run more than one method through `evaluate_market_baseline_walk_forward` without changes); (c) re-read `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s full section list (only Sections 6, 8, 10, 15, 16, 24, 29, 30, 32 are touched so far) for another synthetic-only section worth scaffolding now.
3. Consider whether it's worth just waiting on Jonathan rather than continuing to add synthetic-only scaffolding — three sessions have now built every piece of plumbing that doesn't need real data. Say this plainly in the next session's summary rather than manufacturing more work for its own sake if nothing genuinely useful remains.
4. Keep using `db/setup_local_postgres.sh` at the start of any session that touches the DB.
5. Keep this file updated at the end of every session — add a new dated section above this instruction, don't overwrite prior sessions' entries.

**Do NOT do, even if it seems like faster progress (still applies):**
- Do not fabricate racecard/odds/result data to "demo" a working pipeline
- Do not create accounts on Jonathan's behalf (Racing API, Kaggle, Betfair)
- Do not scrape britishhorseracing.com or any other site not yet permission-checked
- Do not skip re-running the full test suite before committing — all 64 tests must actually pass, not just the new ones

## 2026-09-08 — Session 4 (interactive, Jonathan's own machine)

**The blocker is cleared.** Jonathan signed up for The Racing API and sent real credentials. This is the milestone the last three sessions were waiting on.

**What's genuinely done and verified this session:**
- Credentials stored in `.env` (gitignored, never committed) — see `.env.example` for the template
- Fixed `src/providers/racecard_theracingapi.py`: auth is HTTP Basic (username+password), NOT a bearer token as the old stub guessed — confirmed from the real published OpenAPI spec (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory/.../theracingapi.com/1.0.0/openapi.yaml`) and a live call
- **First real API call succeeded**: `/v1/racecards/free?day=today` returned 54 real races (17 FR, 29 GB, 8 IRE) for 2026-09-08. Field mapping in the provider now matches the real `RacecardBasic`/`RunnerBasic` schema exactly (verified against the OpenAPI spec, not guessed)
- **Real bug found and fixed live**: the API's own `off_time` field is ambiguous (e.g. `"1:12"`, no AM/PM) — Leicester's real 13:12 race was returned as `"1:12"`, and a naive TIME cast in Postgres silently read it as 01:12 AM. Fixed by deriving off_time from `off_dt` (a full ISO datetime with timezone) instead of trusting the provider's own ambiguous string. Regression test added: `tests/test_racecard_theracingapi.py::test_ambiguous_off_time_is_corrected_via_off_dt`, using the exact real Leicester race as its fixture.
- Also fixed: distance conversion (`distance_f`, furlongs as a string) × 220 → yards, not left null as the old stub did
- **`scripts/collect_racecards.py` — new, real, run successfully**: pulled today's 29 real GB races into the live database — 29 `race` rows, 248 `runner_snapshot` rows, all real horses/trainers/jockeys/form, all with correct `observed_at`/`available_at`/`ingested_at`/`source_id`
- `tests/test_racecard_theracingapi.py` — 6 new tests, all against a fixture built from the real captured response (not guessed field names), including the off_time regression case
- Full suite re-run: 70/70 tests pass
- `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md` #3 updated: **The Racing API confirmed LIVE** for racecards+results on the free tier (£0/mo). Odds are NOT on the free tier — that still needs Betfair or a paid Racing API tier, unchanged blocker for Phase 4's real market data.
- Updated the autonomous routine's own instructions (via RemoteTrigger) to reflect this honestly: **the cloud routine environment does NOT have these credentials** (an attempt to set them as routine env vars didn't take — the API silently ignored the field, worth someone checking why later, low priority) — so racecard/weather collection stays Mac-only for now. The cloud routine should keep building Phase 6+ scaffolding against realistic synthetic fixtures shaped like the now-real, verified schema, not attempt live calls it can't make.

**What this changes for future sessions:**
- Phase 3 (daily collector) is now **genuinely live**, not stubbed — but only when run on Jonathan's Mac (`python3 scripts/collect_racecards.py`), not from the cloud routine.
- The synthetic fixtures used everywhere else in the codebase (features, calibration, walk-forward) should ideally be reshaped to match the real confirmed field formats (e.g. `official_rating` really does come through as a numeric string that needs casting, `recent_form` really is a raw string like `"1582F3"` with no delimiters) — worth an audit pass, not done this session.
- Results collection (`/v1/results` or `/v1/results/today` — not yet verified live, don't assume the field names) is the natural next step once there are results to check predictions against. Verify the real response shape with a live call before writing a parser, same discipline as this session used for racecards.
- Phase 6 (first real model) can start honestly now: real racecard structure exists, even though there's no real outcome data yet to train against. A model trained/scored only against synthetic outcomes must say so clearly, everywhere — comments, docs, and BUILD_LOG.

**What's still blocked:**
1. Betfair Delayed App Key — for real market prices (Phase 4)
2. Kaggle account — for historical bootstrap/backtest depth (helps Phase 6+ validation, not urgent yet)
3. Racing API odds — needs a paid tier (£59.99/mo+) or Betfair instead; not pursuing a paid tier without evidence it's needed first, per `FUTURE_PAID_UPGRADES.md`'s own rule

---

## 2026-09-08 — Session 5 (autonomous overnight, cloud routine)

**Confirmed the credential boundary before doing anything else, per the ground rules and this
session's explicit instructions:** `env | grep THERACINGAPI` in this container returned
nothing. This cloud routine environment does **not** have `THERACINGAPI_USERNAME` /
`THERACINGAPI_PASSWORD` — those only exist in Jonathan's local, gitignored `.env` on his own
Mac (Session 4). Did **not** attempt `scripts/collect_racecards.py` or
`scripts/collect_weather.py` here — both would fail on missing credentials (racecards) or are
simply the wrong environment to be running live collection from at all. **Racecard/weather
collection stays Mac-only until a future session explicitly confirms otherwise in this file —
that has not happened, so don't assume it next time either.**

**Started Phase 6, as instructed:** a simple statistical/logistic baseline model — Model 1 —
built and tested against realistic synthetic fixtures shaped exactly like the real, verified
racecard schema (`src/providers/racecard_theracingapi.py` /
`tests/test_racecard_theracingapi.py`: `official_rating` as int, `draw` as int, `recent_form`
as an undelimited string like `'1582F3'`). **This is still not a real prediction** — labelled
as such in the module docstring, every relevant test docstring, `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` RL-006,
and here — because there is no real (racecard, result) pair anywhere in this repository yet.

**What's genuinely done and verified this session (all real code, all with real passing
tests — 80/80 tests pass via `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v`, up from 70):**
- `src/models/model1_logistic_baseline.py` — **Model 1**, the first FITTED model in this repo
  (Model 0 has no parameters by design; this one has four). Shape: a per-race multinomial
  logit (softmax) over race-relative features already built and tested in
  `src/features/runner_features.py` (Sections 8/10) — official rating vs. field mean, draw
  percentile vs. 0.5, recency-weighted form score vs. field mean, weight vs. field mean. Every
  feature is deliberately zero-centered/undirected (the fitted weight's sign decides whether
  higher is better, nothing is asserted up front — same discipline as RL-004's neutral draw
  percentile). Because the softmax normalises over that race's own runners, the output
  probability distribution sums to ~1.0 per race by construction, no separate renormalisation
  needed. `build_race_features()` gives every runner a full 4-key feature dict always (missing
  underlying fields default to 0.0 = "no evidence either way", flagged honestly as a
  modelling simplification rather than silently done); `predict_race_probabilities()` scores
  and softmaxes a race; `fit_logistic_baseline()` is plain batch gradient ASCENT on the
  observed-winner log-likelihood, L2-regularised, implemented in pure Python (no
  numpy/scikit-learn — both still deliberately commented out in `requirements.txt`; this repo
  has done its own small-scale numerical methods throughout, e.g. `src/market/probability.py`'s
  bisection solvers, and four features doesn't yet justify the dependency).
- `tests/test_model1_logistic_baseline.py` — 10 real tests: exact hand-verified feature
  centering (rating/weight/draw edges checked against hand-calculated field means), missing-
  field defaulting, an untrained (all-zero-weight) model proven exactly uniform (1/n per
  runner, not just "close to"), sums-to-~1.0 with nonzero weights, empty-race and
  empty-training-set/bad-winner error handling, a **hand-verified single gradient-ascent step**
  (same style as `tests/test_calibration.py`/`tests/test_model0_market_baseline.py`'s
  hand-checked values: one race, weights start at zero, gradient and resulting weight computed
  by hand and asserted exactly), and a convergence check (20 synthetic races where the
  highest-rated runner always wins → fitted `rating_edge` weight comes out positive, and the
  fitted model then rates that runner-shape above uniform on a held-out race).
- `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` — new entry RL-006 (Model 1, status IDEA, explicit about what's
  proven — the maths works — vs. not proven — anything about real racing).
- `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` — directory listing updated: `model1_logistic_baseline.py`
  and its test file added; also corrected two lines that had gone stale since Session 4/earlier
  and would have misled the next session — `racecard_theracingapi.py` was still listed as
  "STUB... waiting on an API key" (it's been LIVE since Session 4) and `odds_betfair.py` was
  listed as an existing stub file when it has never actually been written (confirmed via `ls`);
  also added the now-existing `scripts/collect_racecards.py` (Mac-only, noted as such) which
  Session 4 built but this doc never listed.
- Full test suite re-run and green after every change: `./db/setup_local_postgres.sh &&
  python3 db/init_db.py` (fresh container, as every prior autonomous session has needed) then
  `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` → **80/80 passed**, including the DB-backed `tests/test_leakage.py`
  tests against a freshly bootstrapped local Postgres in this container. `pip install pytest
  psycopg2-binary python-dotenv requests` was needed first (fresh container has none of
  `requirements.txt` pre-installed, matching every prior session's experience — not a new
  finding, just re-confirmed).

**What's still blocked (unchanged):**
1. Betfair Delayed App Key — for real market prices (Phase 4)
2. Kaggle account — for historical bootstrap/backtest depth
3. Racing API odds — needs a paid tier, not pursuing without evidence it's needed
4. Real results data — needed before Model 1 (or Model 0) can be genuinely trained/evaluated,
   not a Jonathan-signup blocker exactly, but a "hasn't been built yet" blocker (see next item)

**What the next session should do, in priority order:**
1. **Check for new credentials/results as always** — `env | grep -iE
   "racing|kaggle|betfair"`, recent commits, this file. If still Mac-only, don't re-derive that,
   move on.
2. **Results collection is the single highest-leverage next step**, and it's a Mac-only task
   (needs live credentials) for a future *interactive* session, not this cloud routine: verify
   The Racing API's real results response shape with a live call (`/v1/results` or
   `/v1/results/today` — Session 4 flagged this as "not yet verified live, don't assume the
   field names") before writing a parser, same discipline Session 4 used for racecards. Once
   real (racecard, result) pairs exist in the DB, both Model 0 and Model 1 can be genuinely
   evaluated for the first time — everything before that point is plumbing, however solid.
3. If still cloud-only and blocked: there is very little synthetic-only plumbing left that's
   obviously worth building blind. Worth considering instead of manufacturing more scaffolding:
   (a) an `odds_betfair.py` provider stub against Betfair's public Exchange API docs — the
   directory listing has (correctly, now) flagged this as not written yet; (b) a second Model 1
   variant or hyperparameter sweep (learning_rate/l2/iterations) compared on the SAME synthetic
   rating-signal fixture, to at least confirm the fitting is stable across reasonable settings —
   still not a real benchmark; (c) revisit RL-006's flagged missingness simplification (a
   debutant with no official rating isn't "average", it's a distinct case) as a candidate
   feature once real data exists to check whether it matters.
4. Keep using `db/setup_local_postgres.sh` at the start of any session that touches the DB.
5. Keep this file updated at the end of every session — add a new dated section above this
   instruction, don't overwrite prior sessions' entries.

**Do NOT do, even if it seems like faster progress (still applies):**
- Do not fabricate racecard/odds/result data, or Model 1 training data, to "demo" anything
- Do not create accounts on Jonathan's behalf (Betfair, Kaggle)
- Do not attempt `scripts/collect_racecards.py` or `scripts/collect_weather.py` from this cloud
  routine environment — no credentials here, confirmed again this session, will fail
- Do not present Model 1's synthetic-fixture test results as evidence it predicts real racing
- Do not skip re-running the full test suite before committing — all 80 tests must actually
  pass, not just the new ones
