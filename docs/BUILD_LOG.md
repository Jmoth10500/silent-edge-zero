# Build Log

This file is read by the autonomous continuation routine at the start of every
run — it exists so a fresh session with zero memory of this conversation can
pick up exactly where the last one stopped, without re-deriving anything or
re-doing finished work.

## 2026-09-08 — Session 1 (interactive, this build)

**Phase reached:** early Phase 2/3 boundary (database done, first live provider done, market math done, leakage tests done). Phases 1–2 substantially complete; Phase 3 (daily collector) partially blocked.

**What's genuinely done and verified:**
- `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md` — 5 sources researched via live web search, honestly rated LIVE/BLOCKED/reference-only
- `docs/SILENT_EDGE_ZERO_ARCHITECTURE.md` — architecture overview
- `docs/FUTURE_PAID_UPGRADES.md`, `docs/RESEARCH_LAB.md` — started
- `db/schema.sql` + `db/init_db.py` — real Postgres 16 database `silent_edge_zero`, 13 tables, applied and verified locally (this machine's Homebrew Postgres, already running, zero new cost)
- `src/providers/base.py` — provider interfaces (RacecardProvider, OddsProvider, ResultsProvider, RatingsProvider, WeatherProvider, ExternalPredictionProvider)
- `src/providers/weather_open_meteo.py` — **LIVE and verified**: real HTTP calls to Open-Meteo, no key needed
- `scripts/collect_weather.py` — **ran successfully**, stored real weather snapshots for 13 GB racecourses in `weather_snapshot` table, 2026-09-08
- `src/market/probability.py` — proportional/power/Shin overround-removal, all three implemented
- `tests/test_market_probability.py` — 5 real unit tests, all passing (found and fixed a genuine bug in power_method's bisection bounds for underround edge cases, and added a guard in shin_method for the same)
- `tests/test_leakage.py` — 2 real tests against the live database, both passing; confirms the leakage-safe query pattern actually excludes future-dated snapshots
- `src/providers/racecard_theracingapi.py` — **STUB, untested**, written against public docs, field-name mapping unverified (needs a real API response to confirm)
- `scripts/load_kaggle_historical.py` — **STUB, untested**, blocked on Kaggle account

**What's blocked on Jonathan specifically (cannot be done by Claude):**
1. Sign up for The Racing API (theracingapi.com) — highest priority, unblocks racecards/results/odds in one step
2. Create a free Kaggle account + API token for the historical bootstrap dataset
3. Create a free Betfair developer account + Delayed App Key for market prices

**What the next autonomous session should do, in priority order (all free, no account needed):**
1. Check `docs/FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md` — has Jonathan sent an API key since the last run? If yes, that unblocks real Phase 3 work (test the racecard provider against real data, fix its field mapping, wire up a real daily collector). Check for a note in this file or ask via the routine's summary.
2. If still blocked: continue Phase 5 groundwork — feature engineering functions (Section 8: official rating, age, weight, draw, form; Section 10: relative/percentile features within a race) written against clearly-labelled synthetic fixtures (never presented as real predictions), with real unit tests.
3. Build `src/market/movement.py` — price movement features (Section 16: opening price, current price, price change %, drift/shortening) — pure math, no external data needed, can be fully built and tested now.
4. Build the calibration scaffolding (Section 24: Brier score, log loss, calibration curve functions) — pure math, testable now with synthetic prediction/outcome pairs.
5. Build the walk-forward validation harness (Section 29) as a reusable function, tested against synthetic chronological data, ready to run the moment real historical data exists.
6. Add a Postgres trigger enforcing prediction immutability once `locked_at` is set (mentioned as a TODO in `tests/test_leakage.py`'s second test).
7. Keep this file updated at the end of every session — add a new dated section above this instruction, don't overwrite prior sessions' entries.

**Do NOT do, even if it seems like faster progress:**
- Do not fabricate racecard/odds/result data to "demo" a working pipeline — Section 60 of the build brief is explicit about this, and it would poison the leakage tests' credibility
- Do not create accounts on Jonathan's behalf (Racing API, Kaggle, Betfair) — these are genuinely blocked until he acts
- Do not scrape britishhorseracing.com or any other site not yet permission-checked — see FREE_DATA_SOURCES.md #5
